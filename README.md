# Deep Learning in Pytorch
Implementing the different architectures from data loading to training


# Summary
1. **Basics.ipynb** : Tried to learn basics of tensor and see how it is similar to numpy
2. **data_through_json.ipynb** : See how to use generator in DataLoader to load json data_through_json
3. **pytorch_practice.ipynb** : Tried to implement Logistic Regression on toy data_through_json
4. **Linear regression.ipynb** : Tried Linear Regression on toy dataset
5. **FNN pytorch.ipynb** : Implemented Feed Forward Neural Network on Fashion MNIST datasets and learnt how to train,validate and save final model
6. **CNN pytorch.ipynb** : Implemented CNN model on Fashion Mnis datasets
7. **LSTM pytorch.ipynb** : Implemented LSTM to do sentimental analysis and also learnt how to do pre processing on text data, how to use pre-trained word embedding in the model, how to see trainable parameters of the model and how to use tensorboard in pytorch_practice
8. **language_model(seq2seq) pytorch.ipynb** : Implemented seq2seq language model and also learnt how to use variable length input for lstm and how to do some pre-processing on datasets
